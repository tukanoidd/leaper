# Not Ready for Daily Use!!!

## Anyway, what is it?
1. App Launcher
2. (Planned) File Finder
3. Maybe more

## Why
All existing ones ive tried either have issues with styling on NixOs on
my setup, or they are too slow to start, which is just plain annoying.

## How to install?
When I think it's good enough for others to use, will write up a guide,
for now this is just for me, but others can try it out of they want.

## Contributions?
Until I release 0.1.0 on crates.io, not gonna accept any, since im still
figuring things out.
